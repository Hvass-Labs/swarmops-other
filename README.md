# SwarmOps - Heuristic Optimization for C#, C, Java and Matlab

These are my old implementations of heuristical optimization such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, etc. as well as so-called Meta-Optimization for using one optimizer to tune the parameters of another optimizer, as used in my [PhD Thesis](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Tuning-%26-simplifying-heuristical-optimization-Pedersen/6a15006253a6212801d666331d1a41fc083c0e61).

## Requirements

Some of these libraries may require the [RandomOps](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/RandomOps) library for generating pseudo-random numbers.

## Installation

See the manuals above for installation instructions.
